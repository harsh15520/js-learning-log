# JavaScript ES6 Classes

## What I Practiced

- Declared ES6 classes with constructors, instance methods, and static methods.
- Created instances with the `new` keyword.
- Used both class declarations and class expressions (assigned to variables).
- Understood where instance methods, static methods, and prototype methods are available.

## Key Concepts

- **Class**: Blueprint for creating objects, supporting inheritance and encapsulation.
- **Constructor**: Special method called when using `new`.
- **Methods**: Functions defined inside classes (on prototype).
- **Static Methods**: Called on the class, not on instances (`ClassName.method()`).
## Code Examples

See [class_examples.js](./class_examples.js) for hands-on usage and experiments.

## Reflection

Using classes makes code for object-oriented programming in JavaScript much clearer and more maintainable. Inheritance and static methods are easier to implement than with constructor functions. Getters and setters allow for more controlled property access.

## Next Steps

- Practice with method overriding in child classes.
- Explore private fields and methods (using `#` syntax in modern JS).
- Refactor earlier constructor function code to use ES6 classes for comparison.
