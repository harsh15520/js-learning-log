# JavaScript Constructor Functions

## What I Practiced

- Created constructor functions with capitalized names for object blueprints.
- Instantiated new objects using the `new` keyword.
- Added properties and methods within the constructor.
- Verified that each instance is a separate object.
- Used `instanceof` for type checking.

## Key Concepts

- **Constructor Function:** Special function used with `new` to create object instances.
- **`this` Keyword:** Points to the new object being constructed.
- **Capitalization:** By convention, constructor function names start with an uppercase letter.
- **Best Practice:** Always use `new` with constructor functions to avoid unexpected behaviors.

## Code Examples

See [constructor_examples.js](./constructor_examples.js) for full code and hands-on experiments.

## Reflection

Using constructor functions provides reusable blueprints for similar objects. Prototype properties help save memory and allow methods to be shared. Omitting `new` can lead to subtle bugsâ€”so the convention is important!

## Next Steps

- Practice with prototype inheritance.
- Try refactoring constructor functions to ES6 classes for comparison.
