# Conditional Statements and Loops in JavaScript

## What I Practiced
- Used `for...in` to loop through object keys (not recommended for arrays).
- Used `for...of` to loop through arrays and strings (unique to ES6+).
- Learned about truthy and falsy values in JavaScript.
- Explored how JavaScript treats different values in conditional statements.
- Practiced loose equality (`==`) and strict equality (`===`) comparisons
## Code Examples

See [conditionals.js](./conditionals.js) and [loops.js](./loops.js) for my hands-on code.

## Reflection

I found it interesting how JavaScript treats different values as truthy or falsy in conditions. The difference between loose and strict equality was clear when comparing a string and a number. Understanding these concepts helps avoid common bugs in conditional logic.

## Next Steps

- Practice with more complex conditions and type coercion.
- Explore other comparison operators and their quirks.
- Learn about truthy/falsy in the context of logical operators.![Screenshot 2025-06-21 190137](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ef0cf203-82f4-422d-80e5-b5603690b856)

- Try using loops with Maps and Sets.
- Explore break and continue statements in loops.
