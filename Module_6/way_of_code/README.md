## When to Use Each Approach
1. **Imperative**:
   - Performance-critical operations
   - Low-level system operations
   - Complex algorithms needing precise control
   
2. **Declarative**:
   - Data transformations (arrays/collections)
   - UI development (React, Vue)
   - Business logic and data pipelines

## Best Practices
- Prefer declarative for data transformations (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`)
- Use declarative patterns in UI frameworks (React components)
- Switch to imperative when:
  - Dealing with performance bottlenecks
  - Working with imperative APIs (Canvas, WebGL)
  - Implementing complex stateful algorithms

## Key Takeaways
1. Declarative code describes **what** you want, not how to achieve it
2. Modern JavaScript favors declarative patterns
3. Most declarative solutions have imperative implementations under the hood
4. Good developers know when to use each approach appropriately
