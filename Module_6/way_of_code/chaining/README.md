# Method Chaining in JavaScript

## What I Practiced

- Implemented method chaining in custom objects, constructor functions, and ES6 classes.
- Used built-in array methods (`filter`, `map`, `reduce`) in a chained fashion.
- Explored the importance of returning `this` from methods to enable chaining.

## Key Concepts

- **Method Chaining:** Calling multiple methods on the same object in a single statement for cleaner, more readable code[1][2][3][4][5].
- **Custom Chaining:** Each method must return `this` (the current object) to allow further chaining[1][2][3][4].
- **Built-in Chaining:** Array methods like `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` return arrays or values, allowing seamless chaining[3][5].
- **Chaining in Classes:** Same principle—return `this` from each method[1][4].


## Best Practices

- Always return `this` from custom methods to enable chaining.
- Use chaining for related operations to improve readability.
- Don’t over-chain—long chains can reduce clarity if overused.

## Code Examples

See [chaining_examples.js](./chaining_examples.js) for hands-on code.

## Next Steps

- Practice chaining with your own classes and objects.
- Explore chaining with jQuery or other libraries.
- Refactor existing code to use chaining where it improves readability.
