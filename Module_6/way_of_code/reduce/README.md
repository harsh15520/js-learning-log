# JavaScript Array `reduce()` Method

## What I Practiced

- Used `reduce()` to sum numbers in an array.
- Counted occurrences of items in an array.
- Flattened an array of arrays.
  
## Key Concepts

- **reduce()** applies a function against an accumulator and each element to reduce the array to a single value.
- Syntax:
- The **initial value** for the accumulator is required for empty arrays and recommended for clarity.
- `reduce()` does not mutate the original array.

## Practical Use Cases

- Summing or multiplying values
- Aggregating or grouping data (e.g., counts, totals)
- Transforming arrays (flattening, building strings)
- Finding min/max values

## Common Mistakes

- Forgetting the initial value (can cause errors with empty arrays)
- Returning the wrong accumulator value in the callback

## Code Examples

See [reduce_examples.js](./reduce_examples.js) for hands-on code.

## Next Steps

- Practice chaining `reduce()` with `map()` and `filter()`.
- Use `reduce()` for more complex data transformations.
- Explore performance for large data sets.
