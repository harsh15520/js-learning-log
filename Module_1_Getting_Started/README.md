# Module 1: Getting Started

## What I Did
- Installed VS Code and set up my workspace.
- Created a project folder and a `Module_1_Getting_Started` subfolder.
- Wrote my first HTML file and added a `<script>` tag.
- Practiced writing JS code both inline and in a separate file.
- Linked `script.js` to my HTML using `src="./script.js"` (learned that `./` means same folder).
- Used Live Server to view my page and checked output in the browser console.
- Installed Node.js so I could run JS in the terminal, not just the browser.
- Ran `node script.js` in VS Code’s terminal and saw my output!

## What I Learned
- How to set up a modern JS dev environment.
- The difference between running JS in the browser vs. Node.js.
- How file paths work in HTML (`./script.js`).
- How to use browser dev tools and the terminal for JS output.

## Code Samples
See [`index.html`](./index.html) and [`script.js`](./script.js) for my actual code from this module.

**Reflection:**  
I enjoyed seeing the difference between browser and Node.js outputs. It was cool to realize that with Node, I don’t need a browser at all to run JS. Figuring out the `src="./script.js"` path was a small but satisfying “aha!” moment.
