# Variables in JavaScript

## What I Practiced
- Declared variables using `let`, `const`, and `var`
- Changed values for `let` and `var`, saw error when trying to change `const`
- Printed variables to console and to HTML page
- Tried declaring multiple variables in one line
- Observed that uninitialized variables are `undefined`

## Code Examples
See [variables.js](./variables.js) for my code.

## Reflection
I found it interesting that using `var` is not recommended in modern JS. Also, uninitialized variables are `undefined` by default.
