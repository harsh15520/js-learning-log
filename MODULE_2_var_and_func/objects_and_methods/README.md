# Objects and Advanced Methods in JavaScript

## What I Practiced

- Used `shift()` and `unshift()` to remove and add elements at the start of arrays.
- Created objects with nested objects and arrays as properties.
- Defined functions inside objects using both traditional and ES6 shorthand syntax.
- Looped through object properties using `Object.entries()` and `forEach`.
- Made shallow copies of objects using the spread operator `{...obj}` and `Object.assign()`.
- Explored immutability with `Object.freeze()` (no changes allowed) and `Object.seal()` (can change, but not add/remove properties).
- Built objects with constructor functions and ES6 class syntax.

## Code Examples

See [objects.js](./objects.js) for all my code and experiments.

## Reflection

I found it useful to see how freezing and sealing objects can help manage data integrity. The difference between copying objects with `{...obj}` and `Object.assign()` was clear, and I liked how constructor functions and classes can be used to create templates for objects. Looping over object properties with `Object.entries()` was also a neat trick for displaying key-value pairs.

## Next Steps

- Practice with deeper object nesting and destructuring.
- Explore prototype inheritance and ES6 class features.
- Use objects in real mini-projects to reinforce these concepts.
